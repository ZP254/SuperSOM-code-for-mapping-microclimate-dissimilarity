# SuperSOM-code-for-mapping-microclimate-dissimilarity

The files incorporate the SuperSOM algorithms to measure the dissimilarity of urban microclimate (see attached paper pending Elsevier publication).

The model is based on RStudio 2022.02.3 for MacOS.

Further references regarding the urban thermal diversity, UTCI maps and study area can be found here. The research project was presented in ISUF 2021 conference in Glasgow, UK.




User guide
Firstly, download all files, including four CSV files required to execute SuperSOM.
Secondly, click into the 'Import SuperSOM.R' file. Replace the file paths before executing the SuperSOM function.
Thirdly, explore the UTCI maps in the 'UTCI_Map.R' file after SuperSOM completes iterations.
Lastly, explore the morphometrics maps in the 'Morphometrics_map.R' file. Note that Morphometrics are not included in SuperSOM's input vectors.
